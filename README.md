new fast consensus

```
after reading paper from phantom GHOSTDAG
and paper from conflux project , i have the idea why not

the yellow one is the traditional pow main chain
every block could reference any of the lower-hash-power blocks 
a simiple order-function can be assigned to the referenced blocks.
